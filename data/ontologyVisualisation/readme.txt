- 'ontology.ttl', the ontology from the project Reconstruire Delille;
- 'delilleOnto_VOWL.svg', visualisation of the ontology.

The visualisation was produced with the VOWL web service (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html). VOWL has an old and a new version, only the old is currently available online. The new offers an integrated zoom in the image and more formatting options.

The new version can be installed locally (on a server running locally) by following the instructions on their webpage. In short, this requires:
- download the ZIP file:  Download WebVOWL (version 1.1.7)
- run a local server (for example, with python Web server)
- upload the ontology json export (can be exported from the online version)
